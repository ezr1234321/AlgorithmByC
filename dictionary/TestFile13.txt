Ohtani is the best pitcher to come out of Nippon Professional Baseball since Yu Darvish—perhaps even better—in 
addition to being one of the best hitters in NPB. Ohtani is a two-way star who’s proved himself against the toughest 
competition baseball has to offer outside of MLB, and while he wants to play both ways and would likely make the 
opportunity to do so part of his decision-making calculus, he’s a potential no. 1 starter. Players this good just don’t 
make it to free agency anymore, and they definitely don’t make it to free agency at age 23. With his skill, versatility, 
and age, Ohtani might be the most valuable unattached baseball player since Alex Rodriguez’s first free agent goaround after the 2000 season
